# Leaflet-Challenge- I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on the assignments longitude and latitude.

The  data markers does  reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudesdoes  appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth  appear darker in color.
This data overall summarizes the capabilty of the plots of the earthquakes from the dataset.
